### Workflows are like pipelines
### What you want to achieve, and how
### Codify useful processes
### [[Yaml]] syntax

### Workflow files glue together existing actions in sequence
- Listen for particular event
- Then run pre-existing actions
- Or shell scripts
### Actions run in virtual machines, or Docker on Linux VM
